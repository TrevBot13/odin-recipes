        <h1>Pad Kao Pra Recipe</h1>
        <img src="https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pad-kra-pao-7-1140x1536.jpg" alt="Pad Kra Pao" width="300" height="400">
        <p>A quick and easy Thai dish that's full of flavor. Pad Kao Pra literally means "Holy Basil Stir-fry". It's a stir fry of ground meat with holy basil and chilies typically served over rice with a fried egg on top.</p>
        <p>Quck note: Holy Thai Basil is difficult to find state side, so you'll have to subsitute for another type of Basil. Due to accessibility for me I often use Thai Basil, which has a completely different flavor profile to Holy Basil. Italian Basil is a better substitute since it's closer in flavor to holy basil.</p>

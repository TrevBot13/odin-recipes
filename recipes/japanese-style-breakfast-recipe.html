        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Salmon</li>
            <li>Kimchi or pickled vegetable of choice</li>
            <li>Eggs 2-4</li>
            <li>Soy sauce</li>
            <li>Mirin</li>
            <li>Miso paste</li>
            <li>Tofu</li>
            <li>Green onions</li>
            <li>Wakame</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat oven to 300°F. Wash rice then add to and start rice cooker. Oil a baking sheet. Bring water to boil on stove. Cut whole Salmon into filets, add to baking sheet skin side down, and season with salt. Add Salmon to oven once the oven is preheated and cook to internal temp of 130°F.</li>
            <li>Measure out 1 tsp of miso paste for every 1 cup of water. Dice tofu into bite size pieces. Once the water has come to a boil put miso into a sieve and place the sieve into the water. With a spoon push the miso through the sieve until it's disolved. Remove from heat. Add in the tofu, green onions and wakame.</li>
            <li>Heat tamagoyaki pan or non-stick skillet over medium heat and lightly oil. Whisk two to four eggs depending on how many you want. Add a pinch of salt, soy sauce and mirin to taste and mix. Add just enough of the egg mixture to the pan to cover the surface. To control temperature and the speed of the egg cooking lift the pan from the heat then return to heat as needed. Once the egg has mostly cooked through and can be lifted easily use chopsticks or rubber spatula to lift the bottom portion of the egg and roll upwards onto itself until you've folded it three or four times. Slide the rolled omelet to the bottom of the pan, oil the pan if needed, then pour more of the egg mixture. Lift the rolled omelete and tilt the pan to let some of the poured egg mixture slide underneath the omelet. Repeat the process of cooking, folding the egg and pour more until finished. Once finished remove the tamagoyaki from the pan.</li>
            <li>At this point everything should be finished. Be sure to fluff the rice before serving. Portion out each of the dishes and add the kimchi, or your preferred pickled vegetable, to a plate as well. Enjoy!</li>

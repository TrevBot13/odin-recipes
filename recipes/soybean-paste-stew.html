        <h1>Soybean Paste Stew with beef Recipe</h1>

        <p>Soybean Paste Stew or Doenjang-Jjigae was called the national dish of Korea by chef and author Maangchi. A very flavorful soup that's rich, savory, and spicy (or not spicy if you want).</p>
        <p>Note: Like most soups this is a versatile soup, so feel free to add different types of vegetables or make an anchovy stock to use instead of the water. Adjust the spice to your preference. I like to add more gochujang than I have listed below. I also use more beef than is completely necessary just to add more protein to my diet.</p>


        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces of beef brisket, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1 medium potato, peeled and small diced</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, small diced</li>
            <li>1 small zuchinni, small diced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Doenjang, soybean paste</li>
            <li>1 tsp Gochujang, hot pepper paste</li>
            <li>8 ounces of medium-firm tofu</li>
            <li>1 jalapeno</li>
            <li>1 scallion</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2qt pot or earthware bowl over medium-high heat. Once hot add brisket and garlic. Cook until beef is no longer pink then add 2 cups of water. Cover pot for ten minutes. Crack the lid if the water starts to boil over.</li>
            <li>Add the potato, onion, zuchinni, doenjang, and gochujang. Cover pot and reduce heat to medium. Cook another 10 minutes and crack the lid if needed.</li>
            <li>Stir the stew to incorporate the doenjang and gochujang. Add the tofu, jalapeno, and scallion. Cook, uncovered, for 3 more minutes or until the tofu has softened and the stew is bubbling. Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
